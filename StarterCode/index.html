          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The following chart will present a correlation on many data points. What will be presented will be the following:</p>

          <p>Percentage of US population in poverty that lack healthcare. And in those in poverty, they will be compared to whether they smoke or are obese</p>

          <p>Next, we will compare the median age against the same three figures of lacking healthcare, smokes, or are obese. Lastly, the Median Household Income will be compared against the same three factors</p>

          <p>With median age, we see some less obvious correlations. There might be a weak negative correlation between median age and the uninsured percentage of the population. This might be due to the presence of Medicare for older individuals. However, full conclusions would require quantification of any correlation. Meanwhile, the smoking percentage shows a positive correlation, as older populations appear to smoke more. This would seem to correlate well with general knowledge, as accepatance of smoking in public has changed over times. For example, while people used to smoke in airplanes, many states now ban smoking in any public place, including bars. Finally, we see no visible correlation between median age and obesity rates.</p>

          <p>It is interesting to note a few other extreme values. Texas had by the highest uninsured rate. It, and Georgia, stand out, even accounting for income level. In a different category, Utah has the lowest percentage of smokers among all states. There is perhaps, some truth to Utah's sterotype of Mormonism, and Mormon's stereotypical abstinnence from various substances such as caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco. Admittedly, though, Utah is also the youngest state by median age, and smoking percentage does tend to decrease with a younger population.</p>
